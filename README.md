# Shopify Integration with Laravel - Detailed README

## Overview

This README provides a comprehensive guide on how we integrated Shopify with a Laravel application. From setting up models and migrations, to handling OAuth authentication, managing products, and pushing them to Shopify. We also cover the steps we took to set up Localtonet to test the integration with Shopify and ensure everything works seamlessly.

## **1. Models and Database Setup**

### **Models**
The main models used in this integration are:

- **User**: Represents the users of the application. Each user can authenticate with their Shopify store and manage their products.
- **Product**: Holds product data, including details like name, description, price, SKU, and inventory. These products can be pushed to the user's Shopify store.
- **Shop**: Stores information about the Shopify store connected to the user, such as the shop domain and the access token required for API access.

### **Database Migrations**
We set up database migrations to define the structure of the tables that store data for users, products, and shops. The `products` table is linked to users, while the `shops` table holds authentication tokens for each connected Shopify store.

### **Seeder**
We seeded the database with some default product data to ensure that when the user connects their Shopify store, they can see a list of pre-seeded products ready to be pushed to Shopify. These products include basic details like name, description, price, and SKU.

## **2. Authentication Flow**

### **OAuth Flow**
The authentication process involves redirecting the user to Shopify's OAuth page, where they can grant the app the necessary permissions. After the user authorizes the app, Shopify will redirect back to the app with an authorization code, which is exchanged for an access token. This token allows us to interact with the Shopify API on behalf of the user.

We set the appropriate redirect URIs in both the `.env` file and the Shopify Partner Dashboard, making sure that the OAuth flow completes smoothly.

### **Storing Access Tokens**
After successfully retrieving the access token from Shopify, we store it in the database. This token is then used for future API requests to Shopify. It is stored securely and associated with the user's shop domain in the database.

## **3. Local Development with Localtonet**

To test the Shopify OAuth integration on our local machine, we used **Localtonet** to expose our local Laravel application to the internet. This tool provided a publicly accessible URL that Shopify could use as the redirect URI.

### **Localtonet Setup**
We created a Localtonet account and set up a tunnel to our local development server. Localtonet generated a URL like `https://xeosa8k.localtonet`, which we used in the Shopify Partner Dashboard as the redirect URI. This allowed Shopify to redirect the user back to our local environment after the authentication process.

### **Shopify App URLs**
In the Shopify Partner Dashboard, we configured the **App URL** and **App Redirect URL**. These URLs point to the appropriate routes in our Laravel application for handling the OAuth callback and finalizing the authentication.

- **App URL**: This is the main URL of the app, which Shopify uses to communicate with the application.
- **App Redirect URL**: This is the URL where Shopify will send the user after they complete the OAuth process. It contains the authorization code, which the app exchanges for an access token.

We used the Localtonet URL as the base URL in our `.env` file to make sure Shopify's callback was correctly routed to our application.

## **4. Pushing Products to Shopify**

Once the user has connected their Shopify store, they can view a list of products in the application. The products are displayed on the frontend of the app, each with an option to push them to the connected Shopify store.

### **Product Management**
We pre-seeded the database with sample products so that once the user connects their store, they can immediately see a list of available products. The user can then push any of these products to Shopify, where they will appear in the product catalog of their store.

### **Product Push Confirmation**
After a product is pushed to Shopify, the user receives a confirmation message. The product will then be visible in the Shopify admin panel under the **Products** section.

---

## **5. Error Handling and Token Expiry**

We handled error scenarios throughout the authentication and product pushing process:

- **Invalid or Expired Token**: If the access token has expired or is invalid, the app prompts the user to reconnect their Shopify store. This ensures that the app always has a valid token for making API requests.
- **Product Push Errors**: If there are issues when pushing a product to Shopify (e.g., invalid product data), we display a user-friendly error message indicating the issue.

---

## **6. Product Display on Shopify**

After the user successfully pushes a product to their Shopify store, the product appears in the **Products** section of their Shopify admin panel. Each product includes the title, description, price, SKU, and inventory information, which was sent to Shopify during the product push.

The product is now available for sale in the store, and the user can manage it just like any other product in Shopify. The product will be visible on the storefront, depending on the theme configuration in Shopify.

---

## **7. Conclusion**

This integration allows users to easily connect their Shopify store to our Laravel application and push products to Shopify with minimal effort. With OAuth authentication and secure token storage, we ensure that the connection is always valid and that users can manage their products efficiently.

By using Localtonet, we were able to test the OAuth flow on our local development environment before going live. With the products pre-seeded into the database, users can get started right away, making the experience seamless and efficient.

This README provides a detailed breakdown of each step in the process, ensuring that you understand how the integration works from start to finish.
